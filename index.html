                        <p>Fashion - the greatest and pivoatal reason to our global crisis of global warming.</p>
                        <p>Fashion - the word fashion has many connotations. Whether it be good or bad, is up to the judgement of the reader. In this blog I will be highlighting the good, the bad and the ugly.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            ""Fashion is the part of the daily air and it changes all the time, with all events. You can even see the approaching of a revolution in clothes. You can see and feel everything in clothes." - <cite>Diana Vreeland</cite>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Fashion has had lots of influences and orginally started as a reason to flaunt status. Over time and many generations you can imagine the world has changed and is no longer just about status. Many issues that are faced nowadays is the growing pollution and overconsumption of fashion particularly through fast-fashion brands such as Shein, Nike, M&S, H&M, Primark to just name a few.</p>

                        <p>Fashion week as you can imagine is the biggest drivers for the fast-fashion world and beyond, influencing us as consumers, clothing companies and the media. Its glitz and glam are the reasons for new and upcoming trends the so called iconic poka-dots to the ripped jeans look of the 80s and 10s from its revival. These power houses of clothing companies have billions and millions of dollars, but its thing that keeps the buzz and the energy surrounding the clothes that we wear on a daily. </p>

                        <p>An excerpt of fashion week from Forbes:
                            "New York Fashion Week brought its characteristic edge and elegance back to the Big Apple for the Spring/Summer 2025 season. With a blend of couture aesthetics and the latest high-end design inspired by streetwear, the season demonstrated that fashion is more than what's on the runway—it's a cultural spectacle. Celebrities, athletes and influencers added to the energy, not just in the audience but sometimes as part of the runway itself. What was once the fading luster of NYFW is now glowing brighter thanks to the big names that graced the shows and the vibrant after-parties."</p>

                        <p>The rise of thrifting</p>
                        <p>From 2021 to 2023, the value of the global secondhand apparel market rose from $138 to $211 billion, and is expected to reach $351 billion by 2027. The online resale market has also exploded, enabling resellers to quick scoop up the best pieces in brick and mortar stores and put them up for sale on virtual marketplaces, often for inflated prices. In 2023 alone, online resales accounted for $20 billion.
                        We consider thrifting a sustainable alternative to purchasing new fast fashion clothes as it keeps clothing in circulation, but the landscape of thrifting is changing as more and more clothes are flowing into donation bins. The sheer quantity of donated clothing is astounding — Goodwill receives almost 6 billion pounds of donations a year. Purchasing used clothes does not fix the problem of fast fashion, which is rife with health and environmental harms.    
                            Is thrifting really sustainable? .</p>
